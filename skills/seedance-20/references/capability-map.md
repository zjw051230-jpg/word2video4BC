# Capability Map — design into strengths, around limits

*What Seedance 2.0 is best at, how to extract each strength, and what to design around. Load before prompt planning.

## Design INTO these

| Capability | Extraction move |
|---|---|
| Multi-shot in one call [official] | `Shot 1:/2:/3:` labels · one action + one camera each · Standard tier · 10–15s/`auto` · shots×seconds budget |
| Native synced audio [official] | name specific sounds; dialogue as a natural quoted line on-screen; short lines; clean front face ref; SFX>music>dialogue — test dialogue first |
| Role-separated references [official] | per-asset role **+ exclusion** ("motion only, no appearance") |
| Motion transfer via @Video [official/field] | donor clip for choreography/camera rhythm + identity @Image |
| Audio-as-clock via @Audio [field] | "cut on the beat of @Audio1; the turn lands on the drop" |
| First/last frame [official] | lock endpoints; prompt initiate→travel→resolve; transformations & match-cuts |
| Literal camera verbs [official] | one motivated move per shot |
| Physics [official claim] | physical verbs & consequences, not pose adjectives |
| Slow motion [official] | Standard tier; on the single key action |
| Transformation [field] | endpoint states + the persisting carrier; hard cases → FLF decomposition |
| 2D/anime [field] | medium grammar: cel over painted bg, sakuga vs held frames, impact frames/speed lines/smears; no lens/DOF talk — full grammar in `[ref:2d-anime-grammar]` |
| Formats & `auto` [official] | 21:9 for cinema; `auto` sizes duration to complexity |
| Multilingual [official/field] | zh anchors for texture/mood; keep reference tags exact |

## Design AROUND these

For connected generations, design around continuity drift by keeping each clip small, recording accepted observed state, preserving exact reference roles, and re-anchoring on schedule at the scene's chain-depth cap instead of waiting for visible drift. This is workflow guidance, not a deterministic platform guarantee.

Surface duration caps are active-surface facts, not universal Seedance facts; audio is not continuous across separate calls, so score in post when needed [official] · on-screen text → post [official] · negation summons — exclude compositionally [field] · tiny detail (distant faces, hands, logos) degrades [field] · facial micro-acting weakest — stage emotion in body/staging, ration CUs [heuristic] · visible drift after repeated chained generations — re-anchor original refs [field] · character↔prop physics fragile in multi-person shots — keep contact simple or off-screen, use the three-tier action hierarchy [field] · Fast tier behavior is surface-specific [field] · seed = stabilizer, not lock [official].

## Competitive Context *(2026-06-14)*

Native audio is no longer a Seedance-unique differentiator — as of mid-2026 Veo 3.1, Sora 2, Kling 3.0, Runway Gen-4.5, Hailuo 2.3, and Vidu Q3 all ship it [tech-press]. Lead with what is still distinctive in combination — single-pass multimodal references (text+image+video+audio together), multi-shot from one prompt, and multilingual lip-sync — rather than selling native audio as a headline. The official native resolution is 480p/720p; 1080p is surface-specific (see `api-status.md`).
